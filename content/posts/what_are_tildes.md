# what are tildes?

So whilst searching for alternative frontend's recently I came across something called tildes. According to tilde.wiki, "The tildeverse is a loose association of like-minded tilde communities. If you're interested in learning about *nix (linux, unix, bsd, etc.) come check out member tildes and sign up!", in *nix based operating systems (~) tilde represensts the home directory, and in a similar sense the tilde's are a reminiscence of old multi-user *nix mainframes. When I first discovered tilde's it was nothing less than magical. I had no idea something like this existed on the mainstream internet. These are some of the tilde's you can try, if you are interested.
